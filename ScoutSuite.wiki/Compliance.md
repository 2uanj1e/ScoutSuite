# AWS

Use of Scout Suite does not require AWS users to complete and submit the AWS Vulnerability / Penetration Testing
Request Form. Scout Suite only performs API calls to fetch configuration data and identify security gaps, which is not
considered security scanning as it does not impact AWS' network and applications.

# Azure

Use of Scout Suite does not require Azure users to contact Microsoft to begin testing. The only requirement is that
users abide by the Microsoft Cloud Unified Penetration Testing Rules of Engagement.

# Google Cloud Platform

Use of Scout Suite does not require GCP users to contact Google to begin testing. The only requirement is that users
abide by the Cloud Platform Acceptable Use Policy and the Terms of Service and ensure that tests only affect projects
you own (and not other customers' applications).
